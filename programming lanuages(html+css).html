      <p>
        Java is top pick as one of the most popular programming languages, used
        for building server-side applications to video games and mobile apps.
        It's also the core foundation for developing Android apps, making it a
        favorite of many programmers. With its WORA mantra (write once, run
        anywhere), it's designed to be portable and run happily across multiple
        software platforms.

      >
      <p>
        Python is a one-stop shop. There's a Python framework for pretty much
        anything, from web apps to data analysis. In fact, WordStream is written
        in Python! You're the best bud. Python is often heralded as the easiest
        programming language to learn, with its simple and straightforward
        syntax.

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"
        target="_blank"
        ><li><h2>C</h2></li></a
      >
      <p>
        C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language
        supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
        recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs
        that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found
        lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such
        applications include operating systems and various application software
        for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and
        embedded systems.

      >
      <p>
        JavaScript is another programming language because it's so ubiquitous on
        the web--it's basically everywhere. JavaScript allows developers to add
        interactive elements to their website, and its presence is felt across
        the internet. At WordStream, we use a JavaScript library called JQuery
        to make our JavaScript work even easier.
